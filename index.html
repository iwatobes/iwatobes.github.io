<p>My take on software engineer life has always feel like an adventure. There are vast lands to explore and I enjoy the thrill of having survived/master a new land </p>
<p>This is the journey of a inexperienced software engineer on design his personal blog</p>
<p>font for blog entry: Gentium Book Basic - book like font </p>
<p>font for normal post: Github default - this impress me alot at first </p>
<p>This is my personal page- Design based on Single Web Page (SPA) ideal- Using a combination of js libraries. As I'm familiar with Backbone I feel I need to try out new framework such as angular.js and its companion suites such as angularUI. On first glance Angular seem more complicated and not matured as compare to Backbone.
</p>
<p> I plan on utilizing resources and guides available such as : <br/>
<a href="http://ruoyusun.com/2013/05/25/things-i-wish-i-were-told-about-angular-js.html" > Some guide</a> </p>

<p>this is counter productive but what about using a crawler on my own blog to keep track of all posts instead of a full-fledge db?</p>
